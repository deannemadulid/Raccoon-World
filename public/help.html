        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <p class='qa'>Q: I prefer another password/avatar colour, how can I change it?</p><br>
        <p class='qa'>A: </p>
        <p>You can change the colour after logging in to your account, by
            clicking "View Profile", then "Change Avatar". You can also
            do the same to change your password, by instead clicking
            "Change Password".
        </p><br><br>
        <p class='qa'>Q: How can I switch between rooms in the game?</p><br>
        <p class='qa'>A: </p>
        <p>Simply click on one of the many red arrows <img src=/images/arrows/arrowTopRight.png width=20px></img>
            seen throughout the edges of the rooms, and you will travel to a
            separate area of the game, where you may encounter different avatars.
        </p><br><br>
        <p class='qa'>Q: Can I stand somewhere else within the same room?</p><br>
        <p class='qa'>A: </p>
        <p>Yes! By clicking anywhere within the room, you can change the position of your avatar.
            Note that currently, other players will not be able to see your actual position, though.
        </p><br><br>
        <p class='qa'>Q: Where is the chat, and how do I send a chat message?</p><br>
        <p class='qa'>A: </p>
        <p>In the game, you will see a chat box on the left side, along with the history of messages
            that everyone had typed since you entered. At the bottom of the box is a bar that you can
            type into when clicked on. Simply type your message and press the adjacent "post" button,
            or the Enter key.
        </p><br><br>
