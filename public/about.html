        <p>[This game] is an interactive chatroom that allows users to
            meet and communicate with others.
            <br><br>
            Players can choose between different avatar colours to represent
            them, and enter a room to join in on a conversation. Users may also
            freely travel between multiple rooms in order to participate in 
            whichever conversation they prefer.
            <br><br>
            Up to five different users can join one room at any time, and each
            will be able to see the others' avatars. Players may also use the
            chat feature to write messages to others, and read what everyone
            else has to say.
