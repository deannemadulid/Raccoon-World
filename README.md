Raccoon World is an interactive chatroom that allows users to meet and communicate with others.

Players can choose between different avatar colours to represent them, and enter a room to join in on a conversation. Users may also freely travel between multiple rooms in order to participate in whichever conversation they prefer.

Up to five different users can join one room at any time, and each will be able to see the others' avatars. Players may also use the chat feature to write messages to others, and read what everyone else has to say.

More detailed information about how to use the app and Express routes contained in the phase2.txt file.
