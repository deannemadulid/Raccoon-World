        <p>[This game] is an interactive chatroom that allows users to
            meet and communicate with others.

            Players can choose between different avatar colours to represent
            them, and enter a room to join in on a conversation. Users may also
            freely travel between multiple rooms in order to participate in 
            whichever conversation they prefer.
